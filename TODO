- Add a mechanism to persist a session to an arbitrary backend
- Add a way to expire a stale session (should also try and persist
    the session before expiring it if applicable)
- Look into a more efficient lookup mechanism other than ets
    for storing {session_id, pid} pairs
- Add a way to specify a domain to be used for the cookie and/or
    a way to override/add cookie options when setting the session
    id
